Provides selective social network sharing of pages by using shortcodes. Add page sharing only to the pages 
you want!

== Description ==

Social network sharing is great site traffic builder but when the social network icons do not show properly
on the page to be shared, for example, when you are in a secured session like any-to-any, this can be distracting
and you risk loosing a visitor and most importantly a valid external link to your website.

Shari fixes this by putting the social network icons in a CSS file. Now the icons show in both secured and
unsecured page sessions.

Shari is picky right now and only gives you a fixed selection of the major social networks. If you are nice to her (like
offer contributions), she may change her mind?

The social networks offered include: Digg, Yahoo!, MSN Live, Facebook, Stumble, Technorati, Reddit and Newsvine
