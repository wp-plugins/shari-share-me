Tested up to: 4.3
Stable tag: 1.0.1

Provides selective social network sharing of pages by using shortcodes. Add page sharing only to the pages 
you want!

# Description 

Social network sharing is great site traffic builder but when the social network icons do not show properly
on the page to be shared, for example, when you are in a secured session like any-to-any, this can be distracting
and you risk loosing a visitor and most importantly a valid external link to your website.

Shari fixes this by putting the social network icons in a CSS file. Now the icons show in both secured and
unsecured page sessions.

Shari is picky right now and only gives you a fixed selection of the major social networks. If you are nice to her (like
offer contributions), she may change her mind?

The social networks offered include: Digg, Yahoo!, MSN Live, Facebook, Stumble, Technorati, Reddit and Newsvine
